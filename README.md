dotfiles
========

Introduction
------------

Configuration files (aka dotfiles) for the BayProgrammer.

Uses git-submodules where possible. Don't forget to initialize
those after cloning if cloning directly from repository.

Currently being used only on OpenBSD systems, but nothing intentionally
precludes use on a different Unix-like operating system.
