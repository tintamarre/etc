KVM_NESTED!

Doesn't seem to be needed with Ubuntu 14.10.

<snip>

http://my-techno-arena.blogspot.com/2014/08/installing-kvm-in-lubuntu1404-with.html

$ sudo cat /sys/module/kvm_intel/parameters/nested
# echo 'options kvm_intel nested=1' >> /etc/modprobe.d/qemu-system-x86.conf

</snip>

---

Install dotfiles!

---

Switch to zsh:

$ chsh -s /bin/zsh

---

Manually patch /usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/altwin

Use Vim or something, don't use gedit as root!

xkb_symbols "ctrl_alt_win" {
    key <LALT> { [ Control_L, Control_L  ] };¬
    key <RALT> { type[Group1] = "TWO_LEVEL",¬
                 symbols[Group1] = [ Control_R, Control_R ] };¬
    key <LWIN> { [ Alt_L, Meta_L ] };¬
    key <RWIN> { [ Alt_R, Meta_R ] };¬
    key <LCTL> { [ Super_L, Super_L ] };¬
    key <RCTL> { [ Alt_R, Meta_R ] };¬
    key <MENU> { [ Alt_R, Meta_R ] };¬
    modifier_map Control { <RALT>, <LALT> };¬
    modifier_map Mod1 { <LWIN>, <RWIN>, <RCTL>, <MENU> };¬
    modifier_map Mod4 { <LCTL> };
};
